# fileto

A simple file utility which enables you to: <br>
-encrypt a file using either an inline key (with Vigener cipher) or a matricial one (with Beaufort cipher) <br>
-the above specified keys can be generated random <br>
-compress a file using huffman compression and optimal binary trees <br>

For the OOP version of the latter check [this](https://github.com/StanaAndrei/huffman-comp).
